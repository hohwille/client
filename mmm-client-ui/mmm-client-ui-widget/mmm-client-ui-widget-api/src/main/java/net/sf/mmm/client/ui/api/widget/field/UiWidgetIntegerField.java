 * This is the interface for a {@link UiWidgetTextualInputField input field widget} that represents an {@link Integer}
 * field. Such field allows to enter a value of the type {@link Integer}. For advanced usability the widget shall be a
 * so called <em>spin box</em> that has small arrows to increase and decrease the current value. However, this widget
 * exists in order to expose native support for this feature (that might have advanced features or better performance).
 * If this is not available by the underlying native toolkit, an implementation shall be provided that is based on
 * {@link UiWidgetTextField}.
