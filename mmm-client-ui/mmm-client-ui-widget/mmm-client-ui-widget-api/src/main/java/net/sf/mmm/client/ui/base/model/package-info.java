 * <a name="documentation"></a><h2>Client UI Base Model</h2>
 * This package contains the (base) implementations of UI models for complex widgets. <br>
 * Most widgets can use simple {@link net.sf.mmm.util.pojo.api.Pojo}s a model and will make your life easy. However,
 * complex widgets such as {@link net.sf.mmm.client.ui.api.widget.complex.UiWidgetAbstractTree} will require a special
 * UI model. For simple use-cases it is often sufficient to use a generic model such as e.g.
 * {@link net.sf.mmm.client.ui.base.model.UiTreeNodeModel} rather than being forced to implement your own custom model.
 * Such generic models are provided by this package.
